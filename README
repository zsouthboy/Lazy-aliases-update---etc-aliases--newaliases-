Useful for your own systems where you know what you're doing.

Script is tested under Python 2.6 in Ubuntu 10.10 and 10.04, 32-bit, 
with Postfix.


Why does this exist?
I got sick of having to manually edit /etc/aliases on my VPS.
I give each new site a different email address, so that if they
sell / leak my email address, it's obvious who did it.

I'm sure others have a VPS and do the same thing.

This script appends your alias (with date and option explanation)
to the end of /etc/aliases, and invokes `newaliases`to reinitalize
the database (so the new address takes effect immediately)

Has reasonable checks (for root, for example) and shouldn't blow away
your aliases file(opens in append mode only), but use at your own risk.
